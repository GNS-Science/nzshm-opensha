# Removing 1e-20 buckets from `targetOnFaultSupraSeisMFDs`

## Problem
For `NZSHM22`, `targetOnFaultSupraSeisMFDs` went from magnitude 5.05 to 9.05. However, our min mag was `6.8` and we have no ruptures above `8.54`. This meant we zeroed out all bins below the 6.85 bin and above the 8.55 bin. Or rather, we used `1e-20`. In conjunction, we introduced special code in the `misfits` calculation that handles a resulting misfit of `-1`

The goal of this investigation is 
- to be able to remove MFD bins that need to be zeroed out, and also 
- to be able to remove the special handling of -1 misfits.

## Approach
Kevin suggested:
- `filter` out ruptures before running the inversion. This basically means taking a rupture set, taking some ruptures out and then passing the new file to the script that runs the inversion.
- Suppress ruptures while `sampling` ruptures during the inversion. This means controlling which ruptures are chosen during the inversion algorithm run.

## Result

Both approaches work, but only the `sampling` approach seems to be able to replicate `NZSHM22` results. This is because `filtering` is applied before `target MFDs` are generated, and `sampling` is applied after target MFDs are generated.

With `sampling`, MFDs generated by `NZSHM22_CrustalInversionTargetMFDs` are identical to `NZSHM22` apart from the removal of buckets that were filled with 1e-20. With `filtering`, `targetOnFaultSupraSeisMFDs` is different. 

This is mostly because `totalSubSeismoOnFaultMFD` is based on the min mag of fault sections. If we remove ruptures below 6.8, the min mag of a number of sections changes.

## Data

These are 4-minute inversions using `totalSubSeismoOnFaultMFD` cropped to min mag 6.8 and max mag 8.6.

For the avoidance of doubt, the centre of the smallest bin is 6.85 with a delta of 0.1, resulting in a minimum magnitude of 6.8.

### Full Rupture Set

With `targetOnFaultSupraSeisMFDs` not having any bins below 6.8, ruptures of lower magnitude are unconstrained.

### Sampling

Suppressing ruptures during the inversion results in a visually identical result to the NZSHM22 standard. Looking at the numbers, target MFDs are identical apart from cropping.

Sampling was implemented by setting `NZSHM22_CrustalInversionRunner.enableMinMaxSampler` to `true`, which will omit all ruptures that are out of range.

### Filtering

When filtering ruptures before generating target MFDs, visual result are similar to NZSHM22 with a dip at 6.9. Looking at the numbers, Target MFDs are different from NZSHM22.
